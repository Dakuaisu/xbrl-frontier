# Work log

Dated implementation notes: what was built, how it was verified, what is next.

## 2026-10-02 Phase 0, unit 1: environment

- Built `.venv/` (Python 3.12.14) with the owner-approved set in T-001; `requirements.txt`
  (direct pins) and `requirements.lock` (pip freeze).
- Verified: `pip freeze` shows the four pins. SEC endpoints return 200 with the new User-Agent (O-001).
- Next: pin the HF revisions and verify the FinNI row count.

## 2026-10-02 Phase 0, unit 2: HF pins

- Filled `hf_revision` for `pins.eval_finni`, both `pins.students` and `pins.encoder_baseline`
  with each repo's live `main` commit SHA from `https://huggingface.co/api/<repo>` (queried
  2026-10-01 and re-queried 2026-10-02, same SHAs). These are frozen from now on.
- Built `xbrl_frontier/config.py` (runtime config access and config hash) and `xbrl_frontier/finni.py`
  (snapshot_download at the pinned revision into git-ignored `data/hf/`; raises if the row count
  differs from `rows_expected`).
- Verified: `.venv/bin/python -m scripts.verify_finni` loads the pinned split and the row count
  matches `rows_expected`.
- Data audit at the pin (inputs to the scorer design): one prompt template; 12,310 negative rows;
  261,457 gold pairs; 3,625 instances repeat a (Fact, Type) pair; 41 distinct non-numeric gold
  values (word numbers, dashes, `nil`, `0\xa0million`); 12,758 table contexts; 25,765 unique contexts
  and 25,969 unique (context, answer) rows; `context_index` is a 0..N-1 row id.

## 2026-10-02 Phase 0, unit 3: FinNI scorer, oracles, dedup, slices

- Built `xbrl_frontier/scorer.py` (normalization, parser, global pooled P/R/F1, per-instance mean,
  parse-failure rate, malformed-item count, slice and entity_type breakdowns),
  `xbrl_frontier/oracles.py` (the four `eval.oracles` predictors) and `xbrl_frontier/eval_sets.py`
  (`eval.dedup_policy`; slice keys for context_type, company, fiscal_year, context_token_bucket).
  `train_size_point` is a run attribute and `entity_type` is computed per pair. Decisions are in T-002.
- Verified: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests` gives 17 passed. Oracles on the pinned set
  (raw 28,787 / dedup 25,969 instances): gold copy F1 1.000000; empty F1 0.000000; types swapped
  F1 0.000000; half dropped R 0.500002 with P 1.000000. All are within `eval.oracles.tolerance`.
- Enforcement: `.githooks/pre-commit` (installed into `.git/hooks/`) and `.github/workflows/oracles.yml`.
- Open: O-003 (token-bucket edges), O-004 (company/fiscal-year need the instance map).
